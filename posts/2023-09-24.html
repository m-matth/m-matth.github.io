<p>Welcome ! Here is a logbook on my AI journey.</p>
<p>For most part a return on experience of an average developer on various AI topics (frameworks, usage, <em>ready-to-copy-paste</em> code …).</p>
<p>Hope you may find something useful, arguable or even totaly wrong, if so don’t hesitate to contact me.</p>

<h3 id="the-good-setup">The good setup</h3>
<p>As a rookie ML engineer, it’s really frustating to start learning ML in 2023; a lot of concepts and algorithms, many models available, and finally many questions for a hobbyist side projet. Where to start ? What framework/model to choose ? Will it do what i want ? Is it the best choice for doing it ? if so will it run on my computer ? Do i need a new graphic card or work remotely on a cloud instance with gpu ? How much will it cost ? Often one important question missing though : do i need data and do i have access to a good dataset … but that’s another matter !</p>
<p>Most known free GPU platforms <a href="paperspace.com">Paperspace</a>, <a href="kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> and <a href="codelab.research.google.com">Colab</a>. I only
use the third one, but i assume there all very close to each others. One nice feature with colab is the drive integration, it facilitates a lot data management or model sharing. The understandable access time limit can be annoying for training session; the interface check from time to time your still in front in the computer and disconnect you after 12h anyways, losing all your work. However, saving weigths regularly using checkpoints can balance out the time limit. Also, i would have liked to know, google can limit gpu access on its own discretion for a certain period of time : i spent all my free gpu credits training for tutorials, when time comes to train on real stuff it allows me only cpu acces ! First lesson learnt here : <strong>use gpu for real work not tutorials or test iterations</strong>. And it logical corollary : <strong>use small dataset for testing and for tuturials</strong>. You can reach pretty good results on decent hardware with small dataset, at least enough to understand or try ML algorithms.</p>
<p>I was very suprised to see my 10-year-old 4-cores i7-4790 under FreeBSD as fast as than my professional i7-1185G7 with 8 cores under Debian !</p>

<p>Finally my old good pc, using with the latest cpu-optimized tensorflow will do the job pretty well. Let’s see next time where it can lead us.</p>
<p>Lets call it a day, next post will be more technical.</p>
<p>Be seeing you !</p>
